title: Layout Routes
---

Layout routes are routes that do not have a path, but allows wrapping it's child routes with wrapper components or shared logic. Layout routes are useful for:

- Wrapping child routes with a layout component
- Sharing a loader between all of the child routes
- Sharing search params between all of the child routes
- Sharing an error component with all child routes

To create a layout route, define a route with an `id` property instead of a `path`:

```tsx
const rootRoute = new Route()

// Our layout route
const layoutRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: 'layout',
})

const layoutARoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoute,
  path: 'layout-a',
})

const layoutBRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoute,
  path: 'layout-b',
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([
  layoutRoute.addChildren([layoutARoute, layoutBRoute]),
])
```

In the above example, the `layout` route will not add or match any path in the URL, but will wrap the `layout-a` and `layout-b` routes with any elements or logic defined in it.

> ðŸ§  An ID is required because every route must be uniquely identifiable, especially when using TypeScript so as to avoid type errors and accomplish autocomplete effectively.

## Examples

Simple example with different layouts for authenticated and unauthenticated routes

```tsx
const rootRoute = new Route()

const layoutRoot = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: 'layout',
})

const layoutUnauth = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoot,
  id: 'layout-unauth',
  component: LayoutUnauth, // layout component for unauthenticated routes
})

const layoutAuth = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoot,
  id: 'layout-auth',
  component: LayoutAuth, // layout component for authenticated routes
})

const indexRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutUnauth,
  path: '/',
  component: LandingPage, // landing page component that will use unauthenticated layout
})

const dashboardRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutAuth,
  path: 'app',
  component: DashboardPage, // homepage page component that will use authenticated layout
})

export const loginRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutUnauth,
  path: 'login',
  component: LoginPage, // another component that will unauthenticated layout
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([
  layoutRoot.addChildren([
    layoutUnauth.addChildren([indexRoute, loginRoute]),
    layoutAuth.addChildren([dashboardRoute]),
  ]),
])
```
