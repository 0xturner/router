## Everything is Relative

Believe it or not, every navigation within an app is **relative**, even if you aren't using explicit relative path syntax (`../../somewhere`). Any time a link is clicked or an imperative navigation call is made, you will always have an **origin** path and a **destination** path which means you are navigating **from** one route **to** another route.

TanStack Router keeps this constant concept of relative navigation in mind for every navigation, so you'll constantly see two properties in the API:

- `from` - The origin route ID
- `to` - The destination route ID

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Not supplying a `from` route ID will assume you are navigation from the root `/` route and only auto-complete absolute paths. After all, you need to know where you are from in order to know where you're going üòâ.

## Shared Navigation API

Every navigation and route matching API in TanStack Router uses the same core interface with minor differences depending on the API. This means that you can learn navigation and route matching once and use the same syntax and concepts across the library, even in other frameworks!

### `ToOptions` Interface

This is the core `ToOptions` interface that is used in every navigation and route matching API:

```ts
type ToOptions<
  TRoutesInfo extends AnyRoutesInfo = DefaultRoutesInfo,
  TFrom extends TRoutesInfo['routePaths'] = '/',
  TTo extends string = '.',
> = {
  // `from` is an optional route ID or path. If it is not supplied, only absolute paths will be auto-completed and type-safe. It's common to supply the route.id of the origin route you are rendering from for convenience. If you don't know the origin route, leave this empty and work with absolute paths or unsafe relative paths.
  from: string
  // `to` can be an absolute route path or a relative path from the `from` option to a valid route path. ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not interpolate path params, hash or search params into the `to` options. Use the `params`, `search`, and `hash` options instead.
  to: string
  // `params` is either an object of path params to interpolate into the `to` option or a function that supplies the previous params and allows you to return new ones. This is the only way to interpolate dynamic parameters into the final URL. Depending on the `from` and `to` route, you may need to supply none, some or all of the path params. TypeScript will notify you of the required params if there are any.
  params:
    | Record<string, unknown>
    | ((prevParams: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>)
  // `search` is either an object of query params or a function that supplies the previous search and allows you to return new ones. Depending on the `from` and `to` route, you may need to supply none, some or all of the query params. TypeScript will notify you of the required search params if there are any.
  search:
    | Record<string, unknown>
    | ((prevSearch: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>)
  // `hash` is either a string or a function that supplies the previous hash and allows you to return a new one.
  hash?: string | ((prevHash: string) => string)
  // `state` is either an object of state or a function that supplies the previous state and allows you to return a new one. State is stored in the history API and can be useful for passing data between routes that you do not with to permanently store in URL search params.
  state?:
    | Record<string, any>
    | ((prevState: Record<string, unknown>) => Record<string, unknown>)
}
```

### `NavigateOptions` Interface

This is the core `NavigateOptions` interface that extends `ToOptions`. Any API that is actually performing a navigation will use this interface:

```ts
export type NavigateOptions<
  TRoutesInfo extends AnyRoutesInfo = DefaultRoutesInfo,
  TFrom extends TRoutesInfo['routePaths'] = '/',
  TTo extends string = '.',
> = ToOptions<TRoutesInfo, TFrom, TTo> & {
  // `replace` is a boolean that determines whether the navigation should replace the current history entry or push a new one.
  replace?: boolean
}
```

### `LinkOptions` Interface

Anywhere an actual `<a>` tag the `LinkOptions` interface which extends `NavigateOptions` will be available:

```tsx
export type LinkOptions<
  TRoutesInfo extends AnyRoutesInfo = DefaultRoutesInfo,
  TFrom extends TRoutesInfo['routePaths'] = '/',
  TTo extends string = '.',
> = NavigateOptions<TRoutesInfo, TFrom, TTo> & {
  // The standard anchor tag target attribute
  target?: HTMLAnchorElement['target']
  // Defaults to `{ exact: false, includeHash: false }`
  activeOptions?: ActiveOptions
  // If set, will preload the linked route on hover and cache it for this many milliseconds in hopes that the user will eventually navigate there.
  preload?: false | 'intent'
  // Delay intent preloading by this many milliseconds. If the intent exits before this delay, the preload will be cancelled.
  preloadDelay?: number
  // If true, will render the link without the href attribute
  disabled?: boolean
}
```

## Navigation API

With relative navigation and all of the interfaces in mind now, let's talk about the different flavors of navigation API at your disposal:

- The `<Link>` component
  - Generates an actual `<a>` tag with a valid `href` which can be click or even cmd/ctrl + clicked to open in a new tab
- The `<Navigate>` component
  - Renders nothing and performs an immediate client-side navigation.
- The `useNavigate()` hook
  - When possible, `Link` component should be used for navigation, but sometimes you need to navigate imperatively as a result of a side-effect. `useNavigate` returns a function that can be called to perform an immediate client-side navigation.
- The `Router.navigate()` method
  - This is the most powerful navigation API in TanStack Router. Similar to `useNavigate`, it imperatively navigates, but is available everywhere you have access to your router.

‚ö†Ô∏è None of these APIs are a replacement for server-side redirects. If you are ever needing to redirect a user immediately from one route to another before mounting your application, you should use a server-side redirect instead of a client-side navigation.

## `<Link>` Component

The `Link` component is the most common way to navigate within an app. It renders an actual `<a>` tag with a valid `href` attribute which can be clicked or even cmd/ctrl + clicked to open in a new tab. It also supports any normal `<a`> attributes including `target` to open links in new windows, etc.

In addition to the [`LinkOptions`](#linkoptions-interface) interface, the `Link` component also supports the following props:

```tsx
export type LinkPropsOptions<
  TFrom extends RegisteredRoutesInfo['routePaths'] = '/',
  TTo extends string = '.',
> = LinkOptions<RegisteredRoutesInfo, TFrom, TTo> & {
  // A function that returns additional props for the `active` state of this link. These props override other props passed to the link (`style`'s are merged, `className`'s are concatenated)
  activeProps?:
    | React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>
    | (() => React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>)
  // A function that returns additional props for the `inactive` state of this link. These props override other props passed to the link (`style`'s are merged, `className`'s are concatenated)
  inactiveProps?:
    | React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>
    | (() => React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>)
}
```
