TanStack Router utilizes the [History](https://www.npmjs.com/package/history) package to manage low-level navigation state. As a convenience, TanStack Router exports the `createBrowserHistory`, `createHashHistory`, and `createMemoryHistory` functions from the History package.

```tsx
export {
  createHashHistory,
  createBrowserHistory,
  createMemoryH./link.md,
} from 'history'
```
